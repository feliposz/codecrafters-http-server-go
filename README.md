This is my implementation in Go of the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, I've built a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.

**Note**: Head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge yourself. Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
[HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
and more.
